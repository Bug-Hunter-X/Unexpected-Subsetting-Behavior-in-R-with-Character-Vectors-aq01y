# This code demonstrates the correct way to subset a data frame using a character vector
# by first converting it to a factor.

df <- data.frame(col1 = c("A", "B", "C", "A"), col2 = 1:4)

# Correct subsetting
# Explicitly converting the character vector to a factor
correct_subset_df <- df[as.factor(df$col1) == "A", ]

# Verify the result
print(correct_subset_df)
